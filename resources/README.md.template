# salt

"S-expressions for Actions with Logic Temporal"

An experimental tool to convert a subset of Clojure into TLA+. Although it is experimental it has been used to produce real, useful TLA+ specifications.

You might want to use this if you know Clojure and are writing TLA+ specifications. Specifically it provides:

* an interactive REPL based authoring experience
* facilities for automated unit tests of invariants and actions
* automatic formatting of resulting TLA+ code
* a mapping from TLA+ to Clojure concepts that may facilitate learning TLA+

To use it:
1. Write a specification using salt.
2. Evaluate the salt specification in the REPL as part of the development process.
3. Once it is ready to be run in the TLA+ Toolbox, invoke the salt transpiler to emit TLA+ code.
4. Run the resulting TLA+ specification in the TLA+ Toolbox to assess the temporal properties of the specification.

In your salt specification file require the salt language as:

```(:require [salt.lang :refer :all])```

From the Clojure REPL, transpile a salt source file into a TLA+ file using an incantation like this:

```(spit <tla+-filename> (salt.transpiler/transpile-text (slurp <salt-filename>)))```

Alternatively, the salt transpiler can be invoked from the command line:

```lein uberjar```

```java -cp target/salt-0.0.1-standalone.jar clojure.main -m salt.main <salt-filename>```

# Language Identifiers

The following identifiers are reserved for the salt language.

Identifiers from the Clojure language:

```ns```
```require```
```comment```
```if```
```let```
```cond```
```and```
```or```
```not```
```expt```
```difference```
```union```
```intersection```
```subset?```
```contains?```
```select```
```first```
```rest```
```into```
```str```
```count```
```conj```
```defn```
```def```
```fn```

Identifiers from the Clojure language, whose semantics were modified to match TLA+:

```and*```
```mod*```
```range*```
```map*```
```every?*```
```get*```

Identifiers that were added specifically to support transpiling, they are neither part of Clojure nor TLA+:

```atomic-```
```CHANGED-```
```VARS-```
```line-```
```always-```
```eventually-```
```leads-to-```
```fm-```
```defm-```
```maps-```

Identifiers from the TLA+ language:

```CONSTANT```
```ASSUME```
```VARIABLE```
```UNCHANGED```
```==```
```=>```
```<=>```
```=```
```not=```
```>```
```<```
```>=```
```<=```
```E```
```A```
```WF```
```SF```
```+```
```-```
```*```
```div```
```Nat```
```X```
```UNION```
```SUBSET```
```Cardinality```
```CHOOSE```
```SubSeq```
```SelectSeq```
```Seq```
```EXCEPT```
```DOMAIN```

# Clojure to TLA Concepts

| Clojure | Clojure example | TLA+ | TLA+ example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| set | ```#{1 2}```| set | ```{1, 2}``` |
| vector | ```[1 2]``` | tuple | ```<<1, 2>>``` |
| map | ```{1 10 2 20}``` | function | ```(1 :> 10 @@ 2 :> 20)```|
| map | ```{:a 10 :b 20}``` | record | ```[a \|-> 100, b \|-> 200]``` |
| function | ```(defn Add [x y] (+ 1 2))```| operator | ```Add( x, y ) == x + y```|
| lambda | ```(fn [x] (> x 2))``` | lambda in SelectSeq | ```LAMBDA  x: (x > 2)``` |
| lambda | ```#(* 2 %)``` | lambda in Except| ```@ * 2``` |

# Standard Modules

Portions of some of the TLA+ standard modules have been implemented. They can be referenced from a salt file as follows:

```
  (:require [salt.lang :refer :all]
            [tlaplus.FiniteSets :refer :all]
            [tlaplus.Integers :refer :all]
            [tlaplus.Naturals :refer :all]
            [tlaplus.Sequences :refer :all])
```

The salt transpiler will detect these values in the salt source file and produce the corresponding EXTENDS statement in the TLA+ output.
